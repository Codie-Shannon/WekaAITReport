# Weka Artificial Intelligence Techniques Report
This was a research-based assignment where I had to research, test and write an extensive report on Decision Tree Learning, Clustering, and Multi-Layer Perceptron.


# What I Learned
* Confusion Matrixes
* Weka
* Decision Tree Learning
* Entropy Formula
* Gini Impurity Formula
* Hierarchical Tree Structures
* Information Gain Formula
* Clustering
* Cosine Distance Formula
* Euclidean Distance Formula
* Exclusive Clustering
* Jaccard Distance Formula
* Measurement for Similarity and Dissimilarity
* Multi-Layer Perceptron (Forward Pass, Backward Pass, Backpropagation, Hidden Layers)
